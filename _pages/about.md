In short, I'm about theoretical physics, outreach, and improving the PhD experience for people. 

I'm working through the early stages of a PhD in Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Biology, fitting that in-between emailing places and asking them to do better by students. 
In my spare time, I imagine what I'd do if I had more spare time, currently I'm really looking forward to finding more opportunities for public engagement and science outreach.
