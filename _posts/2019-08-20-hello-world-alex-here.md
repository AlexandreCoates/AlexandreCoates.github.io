I may have started this unwisely late at night, but now I have a little PhD site and blog to host things. For those curious, this site is run on Jekyll, which runs on top of GitHub pages. 
The theme it runs on is [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I'm hoping to write something eventually on setting up a free website using Github, but for now you can just follow [Github's own advice](https://pages.github.com/), or just find a theme you like and fork it!
Anyway, this blog should hopefully act as a little hub for my PhD thoughts, actions and plentiful mistakes. 

I look forward to it. Though I say, this is probably a bit too much effort just to have a place to put up extra information for a poster. 

Guess I better make good enough use of this to justify the outlay!

Have a lovely day -- Alex.
