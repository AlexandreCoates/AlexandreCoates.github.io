## Citations
First I must give kudos to the paper that has inspired and directed a lot of this initial work. That is, **Li, Y. et al. (2015). ‘Momentum rejuvenation’ underlies the phenomenon of noise assisted quantum energy flow. New Journal of Physics**. The paper handily describes an underdiscussed mechanism for noise-assisted quantum transport, that being the prospect of pumping excitation states from lower momenta, to higher momenta. In addition to that, it also provides open source code!

## Animations
As a poster can't show you animations, here are the central figures, now in glorious motion.
