Happy New Year! 

This is just a short update to say that my first paper **Localisation determines the optimal noise rate for quantum transport** is now published in the New Journal of Physics. 
This is a nice personal goal for me, I'm a big fan of open access and had long hoped I could get a paper into NJP so this is a double win. 

As the journal is fully open-access you can read it online or download it from [(_the journal page_)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac3b2c). 
Of course I have updated the manuscript on arXiv if you prefer that format, [(_get that here_)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12567).
Finally a backup is available [(_here_)](https://alexandrecoates.github.io/assets/documents/Coates,%20Lovett,%20Gauger%20-%202021%20-%20Localisation%20determines%20the%20optimal%20noise%20rate%20for%20quantum%20transport.pdf)

It's been hard doing research in COVID so I'm both happy and lucky to have been able to complete a paper that I'm personally very happy with.
Now I'm in my final PhD year so the goal is to see if I can complete one or two other things in time. Wish me luck!
