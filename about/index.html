	<h1>Hi there, I'm Alexandre Coates - call me Alex!</h1>
	<p>This is the page to learn about me, I'm a theoretical physicist at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland. My work is in Open Quantum systems, and I'm particularly interested in Quantum Biology. Right now I'm just finishing the 1st year of my PhD on the Scottish condensed matter CDT, so I've still got lots to learn. </p>
