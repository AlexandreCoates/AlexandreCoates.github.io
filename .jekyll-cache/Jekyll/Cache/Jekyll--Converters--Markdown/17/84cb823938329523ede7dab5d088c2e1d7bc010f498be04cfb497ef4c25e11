I"0<p>I may have started this unwisely late at night, but now I have a little PhD site and blog to host things. For those curious, this site is run on Jekyll, which runs on top of GitHub pages. Anyway, this blog should hopefully act as a little hub for my PhD thoughts, actions and plentiful mistakes.</p>

<p>I look forward to it. Though I say, this is probably a bit too much effort just to have a place to put up extra information for a poster.</p>

<p>Guess I better make good enough use of this to justify the outlay!</p>

<p>Have a lovely day â€“ Alex.</p>
