<p>First I must give kudos to the paper that has inspired and directed a lot of this initial work. That is, <strong>Li, Y. et al. (2015). ‘Momentum rejuvenation’ underlies the phenomenon of noise assisted quantum energy flow. New Journal of Physics</strong>. The paper handily describes an underdiscussed mechanism for noise-assisted quantum transport, that being the prospect of pumping excitation states from lower momenta, to higher momenta. In addition to that, it also provides open source code!</p>
