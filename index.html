<h2> Welcome! </h2>

This site is the home for all my PhD-related things. Whether that's posters I present, talks I give, or just scattered thoughts I have on PhDs in general. 

My interests are not only in research but also cover outreach and trying to make Universities kinder places to be for everyone, especially groups like disabled and queer students.
Or sometimes I might just talk about a fun department quiz - who knows! 

See some of my blog posts below or go to the <a href="/tags/">tags page</a> to have a more granular look. For more info or contact details, see the <a href="/about/">about page</a>.
