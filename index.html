	<h1>Hi there, I'm Alexandre Coates</h1>
	<p>This is my simple site for putting together things, thoughts and resources related in <i>any way</i> to my PhD. So academically this is where to find me. If you want to contact me I'm also reachable at the email in the page footer. You can go to my About Me page to <a href="/about">learn more about me</a>, or you're welcome to browse the site at your leisure. Hope you find what you were looking for.</p>
